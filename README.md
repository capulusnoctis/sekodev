## Seko.dev

So this is the repo of my own website. For me, this website is more than just an space on the web with a domain. So here you're gonna find some info about me like where I come from, what are my skills and interests, and some experiments that reflects my essence.

By the way... If you want to know where does the "Seko" thing comes from, you should take a look to the site. ðŸ˜‰
